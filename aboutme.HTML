    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>I love lab puppies. My lab's name is Duffy, she isn't a puppy anymore. She is 4 years old now.</p>
    <p>I like to play sports and the harp during my free time. I also enjoy sketching.</p>
    <p>I play many sports, such as: lacrosse, swimming, tennis, field hockey, etc.</p>
    <p>I love to travel, with my family and for sports teams. I have been to: Ireland, Bermuda, Cape Cod, the Hamptons, Montauk, and Florida for family vacations. And for sports I have been to: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Florida, and Randall's Island.></p>
    <p>My hobbies are: watching movies, playing with my dog, coding in the GWC program at BOA, and having fun with my friends.</p>
    <p>A fun fact about me is that my family is from America, Ireland, and Australia.</p>
